### Multi-dimensional Characterization of Flooding Events over Indian Peninsular Region using Machine Learning
- Analyzed Flood Dataset of Indian Peninsular region from 1965-2019 spatially and temporally using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib,
Geo-Pandas and folium Python libraries on **IIT Delhi High Performance Computing**.
- Computed Hydrologic Signatures such as Mean Annual Flow, Mean Annual Monsoon Flow, High Flow, Low Flow, Slope of
Flow Duration Curve etc. using Python for Observed Flood Dataset.
- Developed Predictive Models for 7 Hydrologic Signatures using **Random Forest Algorithm**.
